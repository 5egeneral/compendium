## What is This?

This overhaul of fighting styles is meant to address what I feel are gross shortcomings in the entire concept of fighting styles. Existing fighting styles completely fail to provide meaningful options, variety, and differences between each style. Their benefits mostly serve as bonuses so insignificant that they barely make a difference in combat or so niche that they rarely find use in real play.

## Removed and Replaced Feats

These fighting styles are meant as total replacements for all Fighting Styles in general and for the following feats:

- Crossbow Expert
    
- Defensive Duelist
    
- Dual Wielder
    
- Great Weapon Master
    
- Polearm Master
    
- Sentinel
    
- Sharpshooter
    
- Shield Master
    
- Tavern Brawler
    

These feats are no longer selectable. Players who want to take these feats for their characters are instead encouraged to take the Fighting Initiate feat in Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything, which allows them to select a fighting style from the list below.

## Progression

Each fighting style provides one or more benefits when first selected. Additional benefits become available when a character reaches 5th level and 11th level. This level is their total level, not their level in the class that granted them the Fighting Style feature.

## Fighting Styles

### Archer

You specialize in ranged combat. You gain the following benefits:

- Marked Prey: As a bonus action, you can choose one creature you can see and mark it as your prey. It remains marked until the end of your next turn. Your ranged attacks against your prey ignore half cover and three-quarters cover.
    
- Focus Fire: Once per turn, one of your ranged weapon attacks of your choice that hits deals an additional die of weapon damage.
    

At 5th level, you gain the following benefits:

- Quick Reload: You ignore the loading property of crossbows and firearms with which you are proficient.
    
- Close Combat Archer: Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn’t impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls.
    

At 11th level, you gain the following benefit:

- Sniper: Attacking at long range doesn’t impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls.
    
- Counterfire: If you are the target of a ranged attack, you can use your reaction to make a ranged weapon attack against the creature that attacked you. If the initial attack reduces you to 0 hit points, you can take the reaction before falling unconscious.
    

### Bodyguard

You specialize in fighting in groups and protecting allies. You gain the following benefits:

- Interception: When a creature you can see hits a target other than you within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d6 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). If you are wielding a shield, the damage is reduced by 2d6 + your proficiency bonus instead.
    

At 5th level, you gain the following benefits:

- Avenger: Your weapon attacks deal +2 damage to creatures that have attacked targets other than you since the end of your last turn.
    
- Warden’s Strike: As a bonus action, you can choose one creature you can see and mark it as your ward. It remains marked until the end of your next turn. Once per turn when your ward is attacked, you can make an opportunity attack without using a reaction against the attacker if it is within your weapon’s reach.
    

At 11th level, you gain the following benefit:

- Phalanx: While you are not incapacitated or prone, you provide half cover to all creatures of your choice that are within 5 feet of you.

- Off-Hand Parry: You gain a +1 bonus to AC while you are wielding a separate melee weapon in each hand.
    

At 5th level, you gain the following benefit:

- Twin Fangs: While you are holding two weapons, you gain a second reaction that can only be used to make opportunity attacks. You can still only take one reaction per turn.
    

At 11th level, you gain the following benefit:

- Whirling Follow-Up: If you miss a melee weapon attack while engaging in two-weapon fighting, you can attempt another attack with the other weapon you are holding. You can only use this benefit once per turn.
    

### Duelist

You specialize in using a single weapon at a time. You gain the following benefits:

- Strong Swordarm: Once per turn, one of your melee weapon attacks of your choice that hits deals an additional die of weapon damage. This feature can only be used if you are wielding a weapon in one hand, and holding no other weapons.
    

At 5th level, you gain the following benefit:

- Fancy Footwork: As a bonus action, you can swap locations with one creature of your size or smaller within 5 feet of you, provided there is no barrier (such as a wall, fence, bars, or a portcullis) between you that prevents movement.
    

At 11th level, you gain the following benefit:

- Deflection: When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons and you are hit with a weapon attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you.
    

### Great Weapon Master

You specialize in using two-handed weapons. You gain the following benefits:

- Collateral Damage: When you miss a melee weapon attack with a weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you still deal weapon damage to your target equal to your Strength modifier (minimum 1). If you hit, you can instead deal this damage to another creature within weapon range. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain these benefits.
    

At 5th level, you gain the following benefit:

- Wide Swing: On your turn, when you score a critical hit with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands or reduce a creature to 0 hit points with one, you can make one melee weapon attack as a bonus action. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.
    

At 11th level, you gain the following benefit:

- Long Wind-Up: If you have advantage on a melee weapon attack with a weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can forgo advantage and instead add +10 to the attack’s damage. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain these benefits.
    

### Pankratist

You specialize in fighting unarmed, and are in fact more dangerous without weapons. You gain the following benefits:

- Pugilist: Your unarmed strikes deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier on a hit. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8.
    

At 5th level, you gain the following benefits:

- Grappler: When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike on your turn, you can use a bonus action to attempt to either grapple or Shove the target. If you score a critical hit, you automatically grapple or Shove the target.
    
- Infighter: At the start of each of your turns, you can deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage to one creature grappled by you. Additionally, if you successfully Shove a creature while you aren’t wielding any weapons, it takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage.
    

At 11th level, you gain the following benefit:

- Giantslayer: You are capable of grappling and shoving creatures up to two sizes larger than you, and your speed is not halved if you move the grappled creature with you.
    

### Punisher

You specialize in exploiting openings, counterattacking, and punishing your foe’s carelessness. You gain the following benefits:

- Demoralizing Defense: When a creature misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to inflict disadvantage on the target’s next attack roll made before the end of its next turn.
    

### Sentinel

You specialize in area denial, acting as an impassable obstacle for your foes. You gain the following benefits:

- Impasse: When you hit with an opportunity attack against a creature one size larger than you or smaller, the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier, whichever is higher) or be knocked prone.
    
- Steel Thicket: As a bonus action, you can turn all spaces within 5 feet of you into difficult terrain. This lasts until the beginning of your next turn.
    

At 5th level, you gain the following benefit:

- No Escape: Creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you if they leave your reach, even if they take the Disengage action before leaving your reach, teleport away, or other methods that normally do not provoke opportunity attacks.
    

At 11th level, you gain the following benefit:

- Unending Vigilance: You gain a second reaction that can only be used to make opportunity attacks. You can still only take one reaction per turn.
    

### Shield Master

You specialize in shields, using them to maximum effect for both offense and defense. You gain the following benefits while holding a shield:

- Offensive Defense: As a bonus action, you can attempt to Shove a creature within 5 feet of you with your shield.
    

At 5th level, you gain the following benefit:

- Mobile Wall: If you aren’t incapacitated, you add your shield’s bonus to AC to your Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
    

At 11th level, you gain the following benefit:

- Pavise: If you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you can use your reaction to interpose your shield between yourself and the source of the effect. You instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.
    

### Tactician

You specialize in coordinating your allies to fight using teamwork. You gain the following benefits:

- Priority Target: As a bonus action, you can choose one creature you can see and mark it as a priority target. All attacks against the marked creature score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. It remains marked until the end of your next turn.
    

At 5th level, you gain the following benefit:

- Fakeout: When you miss with a weapon attack, the next attack against that target before the end of your next turn has advantage.
    

At 11th level, you gain the following benefit:

- Seize the Initiative: When you roll initiative, roll 2d20 instead of 1d20. You choose which one to use for your own initiative roll. You then select one creature you can see. That creature uses the other d20 roll as its initiative, regardless of what it originally rolled.
