A bodyguard is some sort of monster used by others used to protect them from physical harm. Some are trained warriors that use their skills for defense. Others use their brute force to attack a threat until they stop moving.

***Alert.*** The monster has advantage on initiative rolls, and it can't be surprised while it is conscious.

***Guard (Reaction).*** When an ally of the monster within 5 feet of it is hit by an attack, the monster causes itself to be hit instead.

The monster also gains one of the following abilities.

***Hold the Line (Reaction).*** When a creature enters its reach, the monster can make one melee weapon attack against it. If the attack hits, the target's speed is reduced to 0 until the end of the current turn.

***Protective Retaliation (Reaction).*** When a creature within 5 feet of the monster makes an attack against one of the monster's allies, the monster can make a melee weapon attack against the attacking creature.
