Any sentient monster is capable of becoming a spellcaster through a variety of means. This template provides a quick way for you to add spellcasting to a monster that doesn't already have it.

***Ability Score Adjustment.*** The monster's Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score increases by 2, to a minimum of 13.

***Spellcasting.*** The monster's spellcaster level is equal to half its Challenge Rating (rounded up). It is associated with one of the following classes: artificer, bard, cleric, druid, paladin, ranger, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard. Its spellcasting ability and the number of spells it knows or prepares are determined by this class selection.
