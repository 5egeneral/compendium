The variant, optional, and expanded rules below can be used to enhance combat for martial characters.

### Action Options
This section provides new action options for combat. They can be added as a group or individually to your game.

#### Analyze
When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one attack with an attempt to analyze one hostile creature within 30 feet of you that you can see. Make a check using a skill that is appropriate for the creature you are analyzing (see the Monster Research table on page 148 of Tasha's Cauldron of Everything for inspiration). The check can be contested against the creature's Charisma (Deception) check, or it can have a DC of 10 + the creature's class level or Challenge Rating, whichever is higher.

On a success, you learn two options from the following list (or the same option twice), or some information along these lines, as chosen by the DM (and guided by what the character is trying to study):
- One of the creature's damage resistances, immunities, or vulnerabilities.
- One of the creature's condition immunities.
- One of the creature's basic abilities or traits, such as a Breath Weapon, Magic Resistance, or Pack Tactics.
- The creature's highest or lowest ability score.

When deciding how much information you get, the DM can consider the check's degree of success or failure. For instance, you might learn a smaller amount of information if the check only fails by 1 or 2, or you might learn more information if the check succeeds by 5 or more or if you roll a 20 on the d20.

#### Bolster
As an action, you can target an ally you can see within 30 feet of you. The target gains temporary hit points equal to your level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 0) if it can see or hear you. These temporary hit points disappear at the start of your next turn.

#### Charge
Every creature can now make a charge attack, using the mechanics presented in the Charger feat. In other words, every creature now has the Charger feat.

As an additional option, only characters of 5th level or higher can benefit from this rule.

#### Defend
As an action, you focus on boosting one of your defenses in order to protect yourself from harm or to shake off an effect. Until the start of your next turn, or until you are incapacitated, you have advantage on all saving throws using one ability of your choice (except Dexterity, which is already covered by the Dodge action).

#### Demoralize
When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one attack with an attempt to demoralize one humanoid you can see within 30 feet of you that can see and hear you. Make a Charisma (Intimidation) check contested by the target's Wisdom (Insight) check. The target has advantage on this check if it has advantage on saving throws against being frightened; similarly, the target is immune to this effect if it is immune to being frightened. If your check succeeds, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against you until the end of your next turn.

#### Outmaneuver
As an action or bonus action, you can attempt to outmaneuver one creature you can see within 10 feet of you. Make an Intelligence or Charisma check (your choice) contested by the target's Intelligence or Wisdom check (target's choice). If your check succeeds, the creature can't take reactions that target you for the rest of the turn.

#### Tackle
If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line before attempting to grapple a creature, you can also attempt to tackle it. Roll to grapple the target as normal. On a success, you and the target also fall prone. On a failure, only you fall prone.

#### Throw
Using the Attack action, you can attempt to throw one creature you have grappled. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this throw replaces one of them.

You make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). You have advantage on this check if you are larger than the creature, or disadvantage if you are smaller. Additionally, you succeed on the check automatically if the target is incapacitated.

If you succeed, you can make an improvised attack using the grappled creature. If you make a melee attack, you can choose not to end the grapple if your check succeeded by 5 or more. If you make a ranged attack, its range is 5 feet, plus a number of feet equal to 5 Ã— your Strength modifier (minimum total of 5 feet); doing so causes the target to fall prone, but also ends the grapple.

On a hit, both the creature and the target take an amount of bludgeoning damage depending on the size of the thrown creature: 1d6 (Tiny), 2d6 (Small or Medium), 3d6 (Large), 4d6 (Huge), or 6d6 (Gargantuan), plus your Strength modifier.

### Cleaving Through Creatures
Using the Cleaving Through creatures optional rule (DMG 272) no longer requires any involved creatures to be undamaged. You can also extend this rule to apply to ranged weapon attacks that pierce through or ricochet off of multiple creatures that are each within 5 feet of each other and within the original attack's range.

For melee attacks, you can also allow attacks to cleave through creatures that aren't necessarily within the original attack's reach. For example, perhaps the original attack causes the target's corpse to fly backwards, hitting and damaging more creatures in the process. Use discretion when ruling on this, and consider requiring an attacker to expend their movement in cases that wouldn't make sense otherwise.

### Flanking Revised
When a creature and at least one of its allies are adjacent to an enemy they can see and on opposite sides or corners of the enemy's space, they are flanking that enemy. While a creature is incapacitated, prone, restrained, or flanked, it is incapable of flanking. A Large or larger creature is flanking as long as at least one square or hex of its space qualifies for flanking.

A creature that is flanking another creature gains a +2 bonus to attack rolls against that creature, unless they themselves are being flanked.

At the DM's discretion, creatures that are not disadvantaged by multiple opponents due to their type (like oozes) are immune to being flanked.

### Grappling and Shoving
This section provides new options for combat relating to grappling and shoving. They can be added as a group or individually to your game.

#### Combat Tussle
You can replace any weapon attack you make with an attempt to grapple or shove a target, rather than those made with the Attack action. This may also extend to other action options that involve similar mechanics, such as Tackle and Toss (see the Action Options section).

As an additional option, the DM may wish to prohibit grapple or shove replacement when making an opportunity attack.

#### Forceful Push
When you attempt to shove a creature and beat their contested check by 5 or more, you can choose to push it up to 10 feet away, rather than 5 feet.

#### Interpose
When a creature you aren't grappling makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to attempt to interpose a creature you are grappling between you and the attack.

If the creature is unwilling, you make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). Unless you have two free hands, you have a -2 penalty to the roll. Additionally, you have advantage on this check if you are larger than the hostile creature, or disadvantage if you are smaller. 

If you succeed, the grappled creature becomes the target of the attack instead of you.

#### Powerful Build
When you gain the Powerful Build trait or a similar feature, the maximum size category of creatures you can grapple or shove also increases by one. As an additional option, the DM may then impose disadvantage on checks made to grapple or shove creatures two sizes larger than you.

#### Rattle
When a creature grappled by you attempts to cast a spell, you can use your reaction to attempt to forcibly interrupt the casting.
The target must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 10 + your Strength modifier. The target's spell fails and the spell slot (if any) is wasted on a failed save, and the target's spell works normally on a successful one.

#### Shove Aside
When you successfully shove a creature, you can move it up to 5 feet to any space within its reach, rather than directly away from you.

#### Yank
When a creature grappled by you attempts to make a weapon attack against a creature other than you, you can use your reaction to pull them away and make it harder for them to hit, imposing disadvantage on the attack roll.

### Two-Weapon Fighting
The following variants can be used to make two-weapon fighting more viable in comparison with other weapon options. They can be added as a group or individually to your game.

Additionally, consider adding the Two-Weapon Expert feat found later in this document to your game if you wish to give dual wielders additional opportunities to invest in their style of combat.

#### Additional Attacks
Whenever you gain an extra attack from the Extra Attack feature, the number of attacks you can make with your second weapon whenever you engage in two-weapon fighting increases by one.

This benefit can be gated behind the Dual Wielder feat, at the DM's discretion.

#### Better Accuracy
If you have the fighting style for Two-Weapon Fighting, you also gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls you make while engaging in two-weapon fighting.

#### Damage Dice
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can use a d8 instead of the normal damage die for each weapon.

This benefit can be gated behind the Dual Wielder feat or the fighting style for Two-Weapon Fighting, at the DM's discretion.

#### Follow-Up Attacks
If you have the Extra Attack feature and engage in two-weapon fighting, when you take the Attack action and miss an attack with one of the weapons, you can follow up with an additional attack using the other weapon against the same target (no reaction required).

You can only use this ability once per turn; if you gain even more attacks from the Extra Attack feature at higher levels, the number of uses per turn increases by one whenever you reach one of those levels.

This benefit can be gated behind the Dual Wielder feat, at the DM's discretion.

#### No Bonus Action
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, making a bonus attack with your second weapon doesn't require a bonus action. As normal, it can only be done once on each of your turns.

This benefit can be gated behind the Dual Wielder feat or the fighting style for Two-Weapon Fighting, at the DM's discretion.

#### Opportunity Attacks
When you are engaging in two-weapon fighting and make an opportunity attack with one of the weapons, you can make another opportunity attack with the other weapon as part of the same reaction, but you don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack, as normal.

This benefit can be gated behind the Dual Wielder feat, at the DM's discretion.

### Weapon Effects
The following optional rules can be used to add extra depth to martial combat, and are inspired by the weapon properties found in [The Warrior's Codex Reforged](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LTuQ9tRb_ZGFIfKLno4). They can be added as a group or individually to your game.

#### Called Shots
When you attack with a weapon that you are proficient in, you can forgo adding your proficiency bonus to the attack roll. If the attack hits, you add that proficiency bonus to the damage roll. You must decide to do this before making the attack roll. This ability can be used in conjunction with the Great Weapon Master and Sharpshooter feats.

#### Cavalry Charge
If you damage a creature with a melee weapon that deals piercing damage after moving at least 30 feet straight toward a target while mounted, you deal an extra 1d6 damage.

#### Finisher
When you damage a prone creature with a melee weapon wielded in two hands, you deal an additional d6 damage.

#### Prone Fighting
When you are prone and make a weapon attack with a light weapon, you do not suffer disadvantage for being prone.

#### Sundering
Many bludgeoning weapons crush, break, or penetrate armor. Once per turn when you attack an object or a target wearing metal armor with a melee weapon that has the heavy property and deals bludgeoning damage, you can gain a +2 bonus to the attack roll. You can also gain this bonus against creatures with thick shells, metallic hides, and other creatures at the discretion of your DM.
