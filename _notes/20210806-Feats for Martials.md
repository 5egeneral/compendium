## Feat Changes
This section presents changes to existing feats.

### Charger
You also gain the benefits of this feat if your mount satisfies its conditions (i.e. it takes the Dash action, and then it possibly moves up to 10 feet in a straight line).

### Dungeon Delver
The following benefit is added to this feat:
- Increase your Intelligence or Wisdom by 1, to a maximum of 20.

### Grappler
When you successfully pin a creature you are grappling, you aren't restrained. Instead, your speed becomes 0 for the duration.

### Great Weapon Master
When you use the last benefit to augment an attack, you only suffer a -3 penalty to the attack roll, and you only gain a +6 bonus to the attack's damage if you hit.

### Martial Adept
This feat grants two superiority dice, rather than just one.

### Savage Attacker
You excel at delivering death to your enemies as swiftly as possible. You gain the following benefits, instead of the ones listed in the *Player's Handbook*:
- Increase your Strength or Dexterity by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- When you roll damage for a melee weapon attack, you can reroll the weapon's damage dice and use either total.
- When you miss with a melee weapon attack, you can use your reaction to reroll the attack roll and to take the second result. Once you use this ability, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Sentinel
You excel at protecting your allies in combat by drawing fire to yourself. You gain the following benefits, instead of the ones listed in the *Player's Handbook*:
- When you take the Dodge action, you also gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier + half your level, which lasts until the start of your next turn.
- As a bonus action, you can enter a protective stance until the start of your next turn. For the duration, you can force any attack targeted at an ally within your reach to target you instead, even if you would normally be outside of its range or reach.

### Sharpshooter
When you use the last benefit to augment an attack, you only suffer a -3 penalty to the attack roll, and you only gain a +6 bonus to the attack's damage if you hit.

### Shield Master
The first benefit of the feat now reads:
- As a bonus action on your turn, you can attempt to shove a creature within 5 feet of you with your shield.

## New Feats
New feats are presented here in alphabetical order.

### Bulwark
The defensive uses of your shield can be extended to your allies as well. You gain the following benefits while you are wielding a shield:
- Each ally within 5 feet of you that doesn't have this feat gains half cover while you aren't incapacitated or prone.
- When you move on your turn, you can allow an ally within 5 feet of you that isn't incapacitated and doesn't have a speed of 0 to accompany you. The chosen ally can move with you (no action required), staying within 5 feet of you when possible, but you can't move more than half your speed during the turn.

### Light Armor Master
*Prerequisite: Proficiency with light armor*

You have practiced moving in light armor to gain the following benefits:
- Increase your Dexterity by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- Your speed increases by 5 feet while you aren't wearing medium or heavy armor.
- Once on each of your turns, you can choose for a 5-foot portion of your movement to not provoke opportunity attacks.

### Opportunist
You have mastered techniques to take advantage of every drop in any enemy's guard, gaining the following benefits:
- Creatures provoke opportunity attacks from you even if they take the Disengage action before leaving your reach.
- Creatures also provoke opportunity attacks from you when they make an attack against a target other than you (and that target doesn't have this feat) and when they stand up from being prone.
- When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, you can also move up to 5 feet without provoking opportunity attacks yourself.

### Pugilist
You become a master of unarmed combat, granting you the following benefits:
- You gain a +1 bonus to damage rolls you make with your unarmed strikes.
- Whenever you have advantage on a melee attack roll you make with an unarmed strike and hit, you can automatically grapple or shove the target (your choice) if the lower of the two d20 rolls would also hit the target.
- When you make an opportunity attack with your unarmed strikes, you have advantage on the attack roll.
- You do not have disadvantage on attack rolls made for your unarmed strikes while prone.

### Two-Weapon Expert
You gain new techniques that you can use while fighting with two weapons, granting you the following benefits while engaging in two-weapon fighting:
- Checks and saves you make to avoid being disarmed of the weapons have advantage.
- If you don't take the Attack, Cast a Spell, or Ready action on your turn, you can use your bonus action to make an attack with one of the weapons.
- As part of the Attack action on your turn, you can also sweep your weapons around in a whirling cyclone of death, dealing damage to any number of creatures and objects within your reach. Each target takes damage equal to the weapon's ability modifier, and the damage type is chosen from among those that can be dealt by your weapons.

### Unarmored Defense
You have learned to defend yourself without the use of armor, granting you the following benefits:
- Increase your Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- While you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 11 + the modifier of the ability increased by this feat.

### Unarmored Master
*Prerequisite: Unarmored Defense feat or feature*

Armor serves only to hold you back. You gain the following benefits while you are benefiting from your Unarmored Defense:
- Your walking speed increases by 10 feet, and you gain a climbing speed and a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.
- When you fail a Dexterity saving throw, you can use your reaction to reroll the save and take the second result.
- You have advantage on checks made to avoid or escape being grappled.

### Unstoppable
You can push people around with ease, but moving you requires monumental effort. You gain the following benefits:
- Increase your Strength or Constitution by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- When you win an ability contest to shove a creature or to avoid being shoved by a creature, you can choose to push that creature up to 5 feet away from you (no reaction required).
- When you are subjected to an effect that would move you, knock you prone, or both, you can use your reaction to be neither moved nor knocked prone.
