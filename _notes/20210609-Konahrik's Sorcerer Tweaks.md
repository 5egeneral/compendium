* Each subclass gains [Origin Spells](#sorcerous-origin-spells) listed below.

* (Optional) Spell slots are replaced with Spell Points. (I'd like to see this play-tested more before switching to it, don't know if it's too strong or not.)

#### Inner Focus

*2nd-level sorcerer feature (enhances Spellcasting)*

As your magic comes from within, you have surpassed the need to use basic material components when casting certain spells. You no longer require material components to cast any spell whose components cost 1 gp or less.

#### Sorcerous Recovery

*2nd-level sorcerer feature (enhances Spellcasting)*

When you finish a short rest, you can choose to recover a number of expended sorcery points that is up to half your sorcery point maximum. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

#### Altered Metamagic

*3rd-level sorcerer feature (enhances Metamagic)*

The entries below detail modifications to existing Metamagic options.

**Distant Spell:**
You can use Distant Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.

**Empowered Spell:**
When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to maximize a number of the damage dice up to your proficiency modifier (minimum of one).

**Extended Spell:**
You can use Extended Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.

**Subtle Spell:**
You can use Subtle Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.

#### Improved Metamagic

*3rd-level and higher sorcerer feature (enhances Metamagic)*

You learn one additional metamagic option at 3rd level and again at 7th and 13th levels.

#### Metamagic Options

*3rd-level sorcerer feature (enhances Metamagic)*

When you choose Metamagic options, you have access to the following additional options.

**Altered Spell:**
When you cast a spell and the spell requires a saving throw, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's level to change the saving throw from one ability score to another of your choice. The saving throw can only be changed to one of the same type; you can swap between different physical saves (Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution) or mental saves (Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma), but you can't swap between a physical save and a mental save or vice versa.

(Thought of this usage of swapping between physical to physical and mental to mental saving throws so you can't use the "Hold Person Dex save looks like you automatically fail your save for the duration" joke while still keeping it interesting.)

**Widened Spell:**
When you cast a spell that creates an area of effect, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's level to increase its size. If it is a circle, cylinder, or sphere, its radius is doubled. If it is a line, its length and width are both doubled. If it is a cube or square, each of its sides is doubled in length.

#### Wellspring of Magic

*20th-level sorcerer feature (replaces Sorcerous Restoration)*

When you have no sorcery points remaining at the beginning of your turn, you gain 3 sorcery points. These sorcery points vanish if not used when you finish a long rest.

Additionally, you can use more than one metamagic option on the same casting of a spell. When you do so, the cheapest metamagic option that you apply does not cost sorcery points.

## Sorcerous Origin Spells

At each indicated sorcerer level, you automatically learn the spells associated with your Sorcerous Origin. They don't count against your number of spells known. If you have an origin spell that doesn't appear on the sorcerer spell list, the spell is nonetheless a sorcerer spell for you.
