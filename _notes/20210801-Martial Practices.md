Beyond the exploits for which they're famed, martial heroes can push the bounds of what is possible for ordinary mortals by mastering challenging techniques called martial practices. Using these rare methods, an adventurer can tame any beast, lift any object, and even fake death itself. Although martial practices approach what's possible with spells, they exist wholly in the realm of martial power.

A martial practice is similar to a ritual spell. To use a martial practice, you must learn it and perform it. The component costs sometimes include hit dice. After you finish performing a practice, you gain its benefit.

### Acquiring a Practice
You can only learn martial practices if you are a barbarian, fighter, monk, or rogue. The DM may also allow other classes to acquire them if they have access to the Fighting Style feature (e.g. the paladin and ranger).

You learn martial practices based on your character level, or your combined class levels in each elgible class described above if you are a multiclass character. The DM may let it simply scale with your character level even if you have some levels in non-martial classes, however (e.g. you are a fighter that took one level in warlock). You learn one martial practice at 1st level, and you learn another one at 5th, 11th, and 17th levels. When you level up, you can replace one practice you know with a different one, if the DM gives you permission.

You can also learn the rudiments of martial practices from a skilled warrior who already knows it. Getting them to teach it to you may require you to complete a task or adventure for them, at the DM's discretion.

### Reading a Practice

***Key Proficiency.*** This entry gives one or more skill or tool proficiencies; you must be trained in at least one of them to learn and use the practice. If the practice has you make an ability check, you add your proficiency in this skill or tool to the total.

> ##### Making a Practice
> As a DM, you may find that the sample practices in the next section don't fit what you're looking for, or that a player wants to make a custom one for their character. If you want to make your own martial practice below, consider the design points below:  
> - Martial practices are typically comparable to ritual spells. They might take a shorter amount of time to activate, but they might have a hit die cost (see below), and the effect itself might be less powerful than what a ritual spell can do.
> - Hit dice are used as a component cost to deter constant spamming and to create a choice between out of combat healing and some extra utility during the adventuring day. Gold is only usually a cost if the practice requires the use of external materials or other resources.

### Sample Practices
The martial practices below are presented in alphabetical order.

When tamed, the beast is charmed by you for a number of hours equal to your character level. If you or one of your companions harms the beast, the condition ends.

While the beast is charmed, the beast is a willing mount for you and your companions. Additionally, through sounds and gestures, you and the beast can communicate simple ideas with each other, such as emotions, simple requests, and warnings of nearby danger.
