> Anzu lies helplessly on the floor of the cavern as she watches the Dragon methodically dismantle her party. There is little she can do to affect the situation, and with the damage she has sustained, any hope of clerical intervention is long gone.
> 
> She struggles futilely against the fading of her vision, but eventually she feels herself leaving the mortal coil.
> 
> To her astonishment, she finds herself not in the realm of her God's Chosen, but once again in the Dragon's Lair.
> 
> Her flesh sloughs off the bone, yet she finds herself able to move. The Dragon's back is exposed and vulnerable before her; it would never expect an attack from a dead enemy, after all.

If you die, you may choose **Duty Beyond Death**. You regain all your hitpoints and any resources you may have expended. Resting no longer replenishes Hit Dice, although you may spend Hit Dice when resting to restore your Hit Points.

Speak with your Dungeon Master to determine a **short&#8209;term** goal for the spectre of your character. Once that goal has been achieved, or when you are reduced to 0 hit points, your material form disintegrates.

If you choose **Duty Beyond Death** you are unable to be resurrected through conventional means.
