An abomination is some sort of monster that has been corrupted, diseased, warped, or otherwise changed in some unnatural way. The source of this corruption determines its severity and specific nature.

***Natural Weapons.*** If the monster normally uses manufactured weapons, you can give it a natural attack instead. This natural attack deals the same amount of damage as its normal weapon attacks.

***Senses.*** The monster gains one new sense of your choice.

<br>

The monster also gains one or more of the following traits.

***Abominable Form.*** Creatures that can see the monster have disadvantage on saving throws against being frightened.

***Amorphous/Boneless.*** The monster can move through and occupy a space as narrow as 4 inches wide without squeezing.

***Spider Climb.*** The monster can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

***Warped Mind.*** The monster has advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws.

The monster also gains one or more of the following abilities.

***Aura of Madness.*** Creatures within 20 feet of the monster that aren't aberrations have disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws.

***Feed on Weakness (Reaction).*** When a creature within 20 feet of the monster fails a saving throw, the monster gains temporary hit points equal to half its Challenge Rating.

***Frightening Screech (Action; Recharge 5-6).*** Each creature within 30 feet of the monster that can hear it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC is Charisma-based) or be frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the monster's Frightening Screech for the next 24 hours.

***Stench.*** Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the monster must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC is Constitution-based) or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the monster's Stench for 24 hours.
