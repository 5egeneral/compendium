This document presents an alternative system for exploration that replaces the existing rules in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*.

## Setting the Stage
Before we dive into the mechanics, let's take a moment to review the context and goals of this exploration system.

### Goals
There are three main goals of this system: to be as unintrusive to base 5e as possible, to allow the party to make informed choices, to allow those choices to have a significant impact on the game itself.

#### Compatibility
While the official rules for exploration may be lackluster, it is still a good idea to not deviate too far from them as to minimize the amount of content that is invalidated. This system focuses on expanding on official rules that already exist, rather than deviating from them in any big way. In particular, this system uses the same rules for foraging, tracking, and random encounters found in the *Player's Handbook* and *Dungeon Master's Guide*, rather than attempting to introduce new mechanics where they aren't needed.

#### Flexibility
This exploration system is designed to be as freeform and flexible as possible. While some activities may provide tables for suggested check DCs, no check requires the use of a specific ability score, skill, or tool. Instead, each activity lists a few suggested skill or tool proficiencies that could apply, while leaving the door open for the players to come up with their own ideas that might warrant some unorthodox checks. This rewards players for their creativity while also allowing the DM to make rulings in even the weirdest of situations.

#### Informed Choices
Instead of constant bookkeeping or busywork, this system is designed to create opportunities for informed decisions that the party must make while traveling. In order for such decisions to be informed, they have to receive relevant information beforehand; thus, this system includes multiple travel activities centered around gather information or discovering new things in the environment. The party can then use this information when making decisions on where to go and what paths to take.

Does the party take the shortcut that cuts through the dark forest, despite knowing the monsters that lurk within? Do they go hunting for abandoned ruins, knowing that the region still contains treasure that has been lost for centuries? Do they press onwards into the mountains, despite knowing that food and water are scarce there? Decisions like these are what drive exploration and make for a fun experience for everyone.

#### Party Impact
If the party makes a decision, that decision should have consequences. If just walking around the dark forest took the same amount of time as it would to cut through it, then what's the point of going in? Instead of rolling to not suffer as much, this system rewards characters for their efforts in a variety of ways.

To that end, the mechanics for navigating the wilderness and becoming lost have been completely overhauled. Instead of rolling to not get lost all the time, a navigator can instead roll to find shortcuts that cut down on travel time, or to overcome difficult terrain for the day. This rewards the navigator for their efforts while also creating new opportunities for exploration and adventuring.

### Recommended Rules
This section lists a few variant and optional rules that have special interactions with the new exploration system here.

#### Flexible Resting
This system assumes that the [[Flexible Resting]] variant, or something like it, is being used for the purpose of combat and narrative pacing, although not using it won't necessarily break anything.

#### Optional Class Features: Ranger
The features possessed by the default ranger will invalidate many portions of this system. Please use a variant like the Deft Explorer feature from *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything* to prevent that from happening.

#### Skills with Different Abilities
This system works best alongside the Skills with Different Abilities variant presented in the *Player's Handbook*. When a character improvises an activity while exploring, an unorthodox combination of an ability score and skill proficiency created using this variant can be used to resolve it, which encourages the players to use more creativity and improvisation during their travels.

#### Tool Proficiences
This system works best alongside the rules for Tool Proficiencies found in *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*. While exploring, one of a character's tool proficiencies might apply to the activity they are participating in. This might allow them to make a check using that tool instead of using a normal skill, or it can combine with one of their skill proficiencies as described in the original book.

## Wilderness Rules
This section lists a few essential rules that govern any wilderness environment being traveled through and how it can be interacted with.

### Becoming Lost
The party only gets lost while traveling with this system when the DM says so. This usually happens when the party enters a new, unfamiliar region without a map or some other guide, but it can also happen if the party escapes into the wilderness after being captured or otherwise finds themself in a new area without having willingly traveled there. Otherwise, it shouldn't happen too regularly.

While the party is lost, they are unaware of their current location on any map of the region they have. After a day of travel, a lost party might find themselves up to 2d6 miles away in a random direction from their intended path or destination. To stop being lost, a navigating character can spend a day of travel attempting to regaining their bearings.

### Random Encounters
While traveling using these rules, use the normal guidelines for random encounters found in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*. As an optional rule for when the characters are lost, roll twice for each random encounter check to reflect that the characters might blunder into a monster lair or other unusual threat.

Additonally, consider rolling for random encounters ahead of time, rather than mid-session. You can also forgo random rolls and encounter tables altogether in favor of custom encounters that you create by hand.

### Movement on the Map
This exploration system is built to support hexcrawl games, as detailed in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*.

#### Kingdom-Scale Hexes
The daily travel paces for this system are designed to work with a kingdom-scale map (1 hex = 6 miles). As the party travels through each of these hexes, describe the terrain obstacles and features they face, as well as the general ambiance and mood of the region. While not all hexes have to have interesting creatures, locations, or hazards (as discussed later in this chapter), ensure that each hex has at least one feature or descriptor that you can use to make it stand out from the rest.

> ##### Resolving Half-Hexes
> To resolve travel over a "half hex", roll a d4. On a roll of 3 or 4, the party advances 1 additional hex. On a roll of 1 or 2, the party stays in their current hex.

#### Province-Scale Hexes
The hourly travel paces for this system are designed to work with a province-scale map (1 hex = 1 mile). Consider using this scale to "zoom in" whenever the party takes their time to explore a specific area of interest, such as an abandoned settlement or the immediate area surrounding a monster lair. If the area isn't large enough to span more than a few of these hexes, consider zooming in further and using a minute-based travel pace.

## Resolving Travel
These rules break overland travel down into four different phases.

##### Wilderness Travel Phases
- Establish Goals
- Choose activities
- Resolve activities and travel
- Camp

### Establish Goals
Before the party begins traveling for the day, the players must choose where they want to go. They might have a specific location in mind, or they could just be wandering in a particular direction. Either way, they should decide which direction they want to travel in before the day starts.

During this phase, you should also take the time to establish what general goals the party might have for the day. They might lean towards being very cautious, or perhaps they are rushing for time. They might be in a mood for some combat, or maybe they are instead looking to find some cool treasure. By establishing these general goals, you can ensure that the players remain engaged and focused, and you can also adjust your plans accordingly.

#### Travel Pace
You can use the travel pace rules detailed in the *Player's Handbook* to represent travel across established roads and other relatively civilized areas. However, travel through the wilderness is often inefficient and indirect, even if difficult terrain isn't widespread. To represent this, use the travel pace tables below while in a wilderness environmnet. The first one represents the rate of travel in a normal wilderness environment, while the second one represents the rate of travel in a wilderness environment that is particularly difficult to navigate.

Note that the tables below, as well as the one presented in the *Player's Handbook*, use distances that are rounded to nice numbers. While this may cause them to be slightly inaccurate, the rounding here makes these values much easier to use in play. To avoid these inaccuracies from bogging down your game, consider only focusing on the Distance Traveled per Day column of each table as much as possible.

##### Travel Pace: Normal Wilderness
| Pace   | Distance Traveled per Minute | Distance Traveled per Hour | Distance Traveled per Day |
|:-------|:-----------------------------|:---------------------------|:--------------------------|
| Slow   | 150 feet                     | 1.5 miles                  | 12 miles                  |
| Normal | 200 feet                     | 2 miles                    | 18 miles                  |
| Fast   | 300 feet                     | 3 miles                    | 24 miles                  |

##### Travel Pace: Difficult Terrain
| Pace   | Distance Traveled per Minute | Distance Traveled per Hour | Distance Traveled per Day |
|:-------|:-----------------------------|:---------------------------|:--------------------------|
| Slow   | 100 feet                     | 1 mile                     | 9 miles                   |
| Normal | 125 feet                     | 1.5 miles                  | 12 miles                  |
| Fast   | 150 feet                     | 2 miles                    | 15 miles                  |

#### Stealth
While traveling at a slow pace, the characters can move stealthily. As long as they're not in the open, they can try to surprise or sneak by other creatures they encounter. See the rules for hiding in chapter 7 of the *Player's Handbook*.

### Choose Activities
Each character can perform one activity while traveling, chosen from the options below. Note that each activity lacks a specific check that is associated with it; rather, each activity lists example skills and tools that could be used for the check, as per the character's specific actions and your judgement as the DM. Additionally, note that two or more characters can only participate in the same activity if they all choose different sub-activities to partake in.

#### Bolstering the Party
- **Example Skills:** Medicine, Performance
- **Example Tools:** Herbalism Kit, Musical Instruments

This activity covers improving the party's morale, organizing the party's equipment and other items, tending to each party member's wounds, or otherwise bolstering its existing efforts.

Whenever the party makes a saving throw against disease or exhaustion, the bolstering character can make an appropriate check against the same DC as the effect. On a success, the party gains advantage on the saving throw.

#### Foraging
- **Example Skills:** Nature, Survival
- **Example Tools:** Brewer's Supplies, Cook's Utensils

This activity covers gathering food and water from the surrounding wilderness. It uses the same foraging rules as those described in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*, but expands it to allow for more than just Wisdom (Survival) checks.

A foraging character makes an appropriate check as the party travels at a normal or slow pace, with the DC determined by the abundance of food and water in the region.

##### Foraging DCs
| Food and Water Availability                 | DC |
|:--------------------------------------------|:--:|
| Abundant food and water sources             | 10 |
| Limited food and water sources              | 15 |
| Very little, if any, food and water sources | 20 |

If multiple characters forage, each character makes a separate check. A foraging character finds nothing on a failed check. On a successful check, roll 1d6 + the character's Wisdom modifier to determine how much food (in pounds) the character finds, then repeat the roll for water (in gallons).

#### Gathering Information
- **Example Skills:** History, Nature
- **Example Tools:** Cartographer's Tools, Herbalism Kit

This activity covers research and examination of the region the party is traveling in as a way to acquire detailed information about its inhabitants, its historical or religious importance, or any notable locations of interest within it.

A character that is gathering information makes an appropriate check twice per day: once after four hours of travel, and again after eight hours of travel. You may gate certain information behind a set DC, or you can simply scale the amount of information gathered according to the result of the check.

Information gathered from this activity might aid in the other characters' activities, perhaps even decreasing the DC of the ability checks made for them. For example, if a character that gathers information learns of a nearby religious monument, the scout of the party might have an easier time locating it. More information on the order activities are resolved in is provided in the next section.

#### Navigation
- **Example Skills:** Nature, Survival
- **Example Tools:** Cartographer's Tools, Navigator's Tools

This activity covers various courses of action involving the party's travel time and the path they take to get to their destination. The navigator can choose from one of the sub-activities detailed below.

If the party is moving at a slow pace, the navigator gains a +5 bonus to the check, and a fast pace imposes a -5 penalty. If the party has an accurate map of the region or can see the sun or stars, the navigator has advantage on the check.

***Finding Shortcuts.*** In the wilderness, travel is rarely direct. Even when there isn't difficult terrain, travelers are bound to encounter natural barriers, winding and inefficient paths, and other obstacles that prevent them from getting to their destination as quickly as they'd like. To compensate, the navigator of the party can attempt to find shortcuts that cut down on their travel time. The navigator makes an appropriate check against a DC determined by the nature of the shortcut, as shown on the  Shortcut DCs table below. On a success, the party party finds one or more shortcuts that allow them to traverse an additional 6 miles over the course of the day. In environments where travel paces are even slower than that of difficult terrain, shortcuts instead amount to two hours worth of extra traveling.

When the party finds one or more shortcuts, note that these alternative paths are a perfect opportunity for excitement and adventure. Perhaps a given shortcut might pass through territory controlled by hostile creatures, or maybe the shortcut is a dungeon of sorts that the party must fight their way out of. Note that if the party believes the risk to be too high, they can always opt to not take any shortcuts for the day.

##### Shortcut DCs
| Description | DC   |
|:------------|------|
| Shortcut has a clear road, trail, or well-marked path leading to it | None |
| Shortcut lacks a path but is in open terrain | 10   |
| Shortcut lacks a path but is in dense terrain such as forest or mountains | 15   |
| Shortcut is hidden, with active efforts made to conceal its existence through mundane means | 20   |
| Shortcut is hidden using illusions or other magic | 25   |
| Shortcut is hidden using powerful magic, such as a regional effect that causes a forest's trees to slowly shift and force characters onto the wrong path | 30   |

***Overcoming Difficult Terrain.*** While obstacles like mud, snow, and ice are usually a significant impedement for travelers, it's possible for a competent navigator to overcome them. The navigator makes an appropriate check against a DC determined by the prevailing terrain, as shown on the Overcoming Difficult Terrain DCs table below. On a success, difficult terrain doesn't slow the party's travel for the day.

In environments where travel paces are even slower than that of difficult terrain, the speed the party can travel at doubles on a success.

##### Overcoming Difficult Terrain DCs
| Source of Difficult Terrain | DC |
|:----------------------------|----|
| Difficult terrain is created by magic or some other supernatural force | 20 |
| Difficult terrain consists of significant hazards such as dense trees, rocky mountains, or turbulent waters | 15 |
| Difficult terrain consists of more forgiving hazards such as lighter forests and layers of snow | 10 |

***Regaining your Bearings.*** If the party is lost, the navigator can attempt to regain their bearings. The navigator makes an appropriate check against a DC determined by the prevailing terrain, as shown on the Regaining Bearings DCs table below. On a success, the party is no longer lost.

##### Regaining Bearings DCs
| Terrain                                                                                | DC |
|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----|
| Forest, jungle, swamp, mountains, or open sea with overcast skies and no land in sight | 15 |
| Arctic, desert, hills, or open sea with clear skies and no land in sight               | 10 |
| Grassland, meadow, farmland                                                            | 5  |

#### Noticing Threats
- **Example Skills:** Nature, Perception
- **Example Tools:** —

This activity covers keeping watch for threats, whether they are creatures or natural hazards, while traveling. A character that keeps watch makes an appropriate check whenever you call for it, with disadvantage if the party is traveling at a fast pace. Note that passive Perception scores aren't used while traveling with these rules.

What the character notices with their check depends on the nature of the potential threat and how hard it is to spot. For example, the DC to notice a creature depends on how well it is hiding, while the DC to notice a wilderness hazard depends on how easy it is to see within the surrounding terrain. The sections below discuss possible threats that can be identified by a character that keeps watch.

***Hidden Creatures.*** While noticing creatures that aren't moving stealthily requires no check, creatures that are moving stealthily are much harder to notice. Such creatures can be spotted by using various senses to notice their presence, or they can be noticed indirectly via signs of their influence on the surrounding ecosystem. Spotting a hidden creature ahead of time might prevent the party from being ambushed by it, which would cause them to be surprised when combat erupts.

***Wilderness Hazards.*** While hazards like razorvine and slippery ice can be spotted without a check, quicksand, thin ice, and other hazards might be harder to spot or to identify for what they are. Spotting a wilderness hazard ahead of time might prevent the party from accidentally falling victim to it.

#### Scouting
- **Example Skills:** Investigation, Survival
- **Example Tools:** —

This activity covers scouting out the area near the party as it travels in order to find new locations and other interesting things.

For the purpose of keeping the game simple and fair, you can consider a scouting character to be alongside the rest of the party whenever a combat encounter occurs.

***Locations of Interest.*** A location of interest could be an abandoned settlement, a dungeon entrance, or some other adventuring site, but it could also be an otherwise indistinct place where monsters are currently stationed in. To look for potential locations of interest, a scouting character makes an appropriate check whenever you call for it, with disadvantage if the party is traveling at a fast pace. The DC of the check is determined by the Discovery DCs table below (which is a repurposed version of the Finding Shortcut DCs table earlier in this chapter). On a success, the scout identifies the location of interest, and the party can choose to stop and explore it if they'd like.

Remember that withholding opportunities for adventuring isn't fun for the party. While active scouting should be rewarded on a success, the party should still be provided with interesting locations to explore even if they don't have a scout.

##### Discovery DCs
| Description | DC   |
|:------------|------|
| Location has a clear road, trail, or well-marked path leading to it | None |
| Location lacks a path but is in open terrain | 10   |
| Location lacks a path but is in dense terrain such as forest or mountains | 15   |
| Location is hidden, with active efforts made to conceal its existence through mundane means | 20   |
| Location is hidden using illusions or other magic | 25   |
| Location is hidden using powerful magic, such as a regional effect that causes a forest's trees to slowly shift and force characters onto the wrong path | 30   |

***Tracking.*** Adventurers sometimes choose their path by following the tracks of other creatures—or other creatures might track the adventurers! To track, one or more creatures must succeed on an appropriate check. You might require trackers to make a new check in any of the following circumstances:

- They stop tracking and resume after finishing a short or long rest.
- The trail crosses an obstacle, such as a river, that shows no tracks.
- The weather conditions or terrain changes in a way that makes tracking harder.

The DC for the check depends on how well the ground shows signs of a creature's passage. No roll is necessary in situations where the tracks are obvious. For example, no check is needed to track an army advancing along a muddy road. Spotting tracks on a bare stone floor is more challenging, unless the creature being tracked leaves a distinct trail. Additionally, the passage of time often makes tracks harder to follow. In a situation where there is no trail to follow, you can rule that tracking is impossible. The Tracking DCs table offers guidelines for setting the DC or, if you prefer, you can choose a DC based on your assessment of the difficulty. You can also grant advantage on the check if there's more than one set of tracks to follow, or disadvantage if the trail being followed passes through a well-trafficked area.

On a failed check, the character loses the trail but can attempt to find it again by making a careful search of the area. It takes 10 minutes to find a trail in a confined area such as a dungeon, or 1 hour outdoors.

##### Tracking DCs
| Ground Surface                      | DC |
|:------------------------------------|:--:|
| Soft surface such as snow           | 10 |
| Dirt or grass                       | 15 |
| Bare stone                          | 20 |
| Each day since the creature passed  | +5 |
| Creature left a trail such as blood | -5 |

#### Other Activities
This section lists a few other miscellaenous activities that a character can choose from.

***Drawing a Map.*** The character can draw a map that records the group's progress and helps the characters get back on course if they get lost (no ability check). This can be done alongside a second activity if the character is proficient in cartographer's tools and uses them to draw the map.

***Tool Usage.*** While many of these activities already allow tool proficiencies to be used alongside them, a character can also use their tools in other ways as described in *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*. As most tool usage requires or is best done when stationary, treat a day travel as only being equivalent to a short rest for the purpose of resolving each tool's special uses.

***Improvising an Activity.*** While the entries listed in this document already cover most possible activities while traveling, it is still possible for a character to perform some other activity that isn't listed here. To resolve such an activity, choose an appropriate check for the character to make, and come up with a contest or set DC to determine whether or not they succeed. Model the DCs and results of that activity off of the ones listed in this document when possible.

### Resolve Activities and Travel
Once every character has chosen an activity, their travels for the day can be resolved.

#### Activities 
Activities are resolved in chronological order as the day goes on. If an activity lets a character make multiple checks depending on the circumstances, they will generally be resolved over the course of the day as they come up. If an activity only has a character make one check, have them roll it earlier in the day, but try to have the results of that activity play out over the entire day.

At your discretion, you can allow the results of an activity to influence the check DCs of any of the others. For example, if a character that Gathers Information learns about a historical monument in the region, it might be easier for another character that is Scouting to discover it. When adjusting the DC of a check in this manner, you should do so in increments of 2 in minor cases, and in increments of 5 in major ones.

#### Changing Activities
As circumstances change, a character may wish to swap from one activity to another. For instance, a character that is foraging may wish to start tracking instead once they discover abnormally large footprints that could lead to a monster lair. How to handle this shift depends on what activities are being switched between and how often checks for them are called for.

Activities like Noticing Threats and Tracking can be switched between seemlessly without any additional rulings, as checks for them are made throughout the day whenever the DM calls for them. However, switching to activities like Foraging and Gathering Information that only have checks once or twice requires more care, and should generally only be allowed halfway through the day.

If a character switches to an activity like Foraging, consider imposing disadvantage or a -5 penalty on their check made to do so, or perhaps halve the benefits yielded from a success (e.g. for Foraging, halve the amount of food acquired). For an activity like Gathering Information that normally has you make two checks per day, allow only one check instead.

In general, try to avoid allowing the players to change their activities during the day too often. While such switches make sense when circumstances change or new information is acquired, remember that unnecessary switching can be used in bad faith as a way to powergame the system and can drastically slow down the game in the process.

#### Events While Traveling
After determining if a group becomes lost or has a random encounter, check your map to determine the party's route during the day. From their starting location, track how far they travel toward their destination. Narrate any changes in terrain or any special locations the characters find along the way, resolving encounters as needed.

***Encounters.*** The party should have at least one creature encounter per day of travel. While not all encounters have to be resolved using combat, you can ensure the party remains properly challenged by aiming to have at least one combat encounter and a few other non-combat encounters each day.

***Hazards.*** The party should have to face at least one wilderness hazard or obstacle per day of travel. This hazard can take the form of a mountain range that blocks direct passage, a snowstorm that causes heavy precipitation and extreme cold, or some other obstacle that could impede the party's travel or threaten their safety.

***Locations.*** The party should discover at least one location of interest per day of travel. For each character in the party that is navigating or scouting, add more possible locations for them to discover on a successful check. Since not all locations will require a full day to fully explore, be sure to add enough locations of interest to maintain variety and engagement as the party travels.

> ##### Events and Activities
> Whenever an event occurs while traveling, consider tying that event to one of the characters' activities. For example, if a scouting character rolls high on their check, allow them to be the one to discover the monster lair or dungeon you already had planned. By delivering events through the characters' activities, you are rewarding them for using their agency to make certain choices and putting effort into succeeding at them.

### Camp
After traveling for the day, the characters must find or create an appropriate shelter to spend the night in. Such a shelter must be able to protect the characters from extreme temperatures, precipitation and other weather phenomena, and any other forces of nature so that a proper rest can be taken.

#### Finding Shelter
You can have them find pre-existing shelter through the activities they did during the day. For example, a foraging character could stumble upon a cave inhabited by wolves that can be used as shelter once cleared. Alternatively, the party could use the equipment they already have to create their own shelter. If finding or making shelter is particularly difficult in certain circumstances, you could require the characters to make an appropriate group check. On a failure, the party might have to endure a forced march as they search for a good place to camp.

#### Downtime Activities
Once the party camps for the night, they generally have about 2 hours of free time, assuming they were able to find shelter without a hitch. Characters can spend this time socializing, discussing the events of the day and planning for the activities of the next day, using their tools and equipment, and so on.

#### Nightime Events
If a creature encounter or some other event occurs during the night, choose a random party member to be on watch as it happens. Use their passive Perception score to determine whether or not they notice what is going on.
