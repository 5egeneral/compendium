## The Avenger

A stoic human warrior dressed in nothing but sacred robes darts down an alleyway with his greatsword, muttering an oath to destroy the bugbear that is preparing to strike down an innocent victim. The faith he has in his deity ensures himself that he will not fail to fulfill his duty.

Flapping her wings, an elf with a flowing garb dives into a swathe of goblins, swinging her maul through and through as she darts between enemies who fruitlessly retaliate with their daggers and spears.

The dragonborn prepares his mighty greataxe to strike down an evil necromancer, and with a whisper, seemingly vanishes through the hallway of the mausoleum. The next moment, they reappear, bringing down justice granted to him through their god to the sinister wizard, ending his plot to disturb those who rest in peace.

To be an avenger is to be a holy warrior who fights for their deity before all else. These esoteric warriors train under the rites of religious sects often hidden from public view, learning the secret techniques of their order, and become imbued with the divine might of their deity through sacred rites of initiation. As an avenger, you might work alongside clerics and priests of a particular deity, but you only answer to the deity directly, and the vows of your temple sect.

> ##### Multiclassing and the Avenger
> The following information applies if you multiclass as an avenger, using the multiclass rules in the *Player's Handbook*:
>
> ***Ability Score Minimum.*** As a multiclass character, you must have at least a Wisdom score of 13 and a Strength score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already an avenger.
>
> ***Proficiencies Gained.*** If avenger isn't your initial class, you gain proficiency in light armor, simple weapons, and martial melee weapons.
>
> ***Spell Slots.*** If you take the Radiant Soul as your avenger subclass, add one third of your levels (rounded up) in the avenger class to the appropriate levels from other classes to determine your available spell slots.

### Holy Censure
The actions of your foes empower your attacks, punishing them for their defiance in the face of your deity.

Starting at 1st level, choose one of the following censure options. Each one indicates conditions for a hostile creature to be marked by your holy censure. While a creature is marked accordingly, your melee weapon attacks deal bonus radiant damage to them equal to your Proficiency Bonus. You can change your censure option after a short or long rest, spending 10 minutes of that rest praying to your deity. You must be bearing a holy symbol in order to make use of your holy censure.

***Censure of Pursuit.*** When a hostile creature leaves your reach willingly, they are marked by the censure until the end of your next turn.

***Censure of Retribution.*** Whenever a hostile creature deals damage to you, they are marked by the censure until the end of your next turn.

***Censure of Unity.*** When a hostile creature is attacked by an ally, they are marked by the censure until the end of your next turn.

***Censure of Ignorance.*** When a hostile creature makes an attack against an ally you can see, they are marked by the censure until the end of your next turn.

### Armor of Faith

Also at 1st level, you are protected by your unwavering faith you have in your sworn oath to your deity. While you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 13 + your Wisdom modifier.

### Channel Divinity

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.

Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Wisdom modifier.

#### Channel Divinity: Oath of Enmity
As a bonus action, you can swear an oath to your deity to bring down a creature you can see within 60 feet of you, using your Channel Divinity. You gain advantage on melee attack rolls against the creature for 1 minute or until it drops to 0 hit points or falls unconscious. During this time, the target is vulnerable to the damage dealt by your holy censure.

#### Channel Divinity: Divine Guidance
As a reaction while holding or presenting the holy symbol of your deity, you can use your Channel Divinity to give an ally advantage on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw they make during the current turn.

### Temple Sect
When you reach 3rd level, make a choice of religious sect to be a part of. Many avengers are already part of a sect while training as an agent of their deity, but some avengers have decided to split from their associated temple, working solely on behalf of their deity. Regardless, your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th level, 11th level, and 18th level.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th level, 12th level, 16th level, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. 

### Spiritual Temple

Starting at 6th level, you gain the ability to project a reflection of your soul, a spiritual temple, that provides a number of magical effects. It is represented by an aura emanating from you with a radius equal to to 5 times your Wisdom modifier (minimum 5 ft.), and can be activated or deactivated as a bonus action. The aura, while active, produces an illusionary light or dim shadows within its' radius, which do not affect vision.

If the spiritual temple requires a creature to make a saving throw, the DC is 8 + your Wisdom Modifier + your Proficiency Bonus.

You start out with one effect for your spiritual temple, chosen from the following list. At 9th, 13th, and 17th level, you gain access to an additional effect. You may only have one effect active at a time, and can switch the effect as an action.

***Temple of Shadow.*** While your spiritual temple is active, you and any number of other creatures within the aura are cloaked in shadows, granting advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide, and bright light within the radius is treated as if it is dim light. As a reaction, you can jump through these shadows, teleporting to a location within the radius of your aura.

***Temple of Seclusion.*** When a hostile creature ends their turn within your aura, you can use your reaction to teleport them away to an empty space that is in contact with the outer edge of your aura. Additionally, while you have no more than one hostile creature in your aura, you deal bonus radiant damage equal to your Proficiency Bonus to them whenever you hit them with a melee weapon attack.

***Temple of Respite.*** While your spiritual temple is active, when you or allied creatures regain hit points, the minimum amount of hit points they regain is equal to your Proficiency Bonus. You can use your reaction when a hostile creature attempts to enter your aura to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, their speed is reduced to 0 until the end of their turn.

***Temple of Brilliance.*** As a reaction to a creature making an attack within your aura, you can cause the aura to flare up, blinding the creature until the end of their turn unless they succeed on a Constitution saving throw. Additionally, you glow with a holy light, granting you advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Temple of Light.*** Your spiritual temple imbues radiant energy into your attacks and those of your allies. Whenever a friendly creature in your aura makes a melee attack and hits for the first time each turn, the attack deals bonus radiant damage equal to your Proficiency Bonus. Additionally, the aura radiates bright light up to its' radius, and magical darkness within the radius is treated as if it didn't exist.

***Temple of Resolution.*** Your spiritual temple compels foes to meet their end, and prevents interference from outsiders. When a hostile creature starts their turn in your aura, you can use your reaction to force them to make a Charisma saving throw. If they fail, they cannot willingly leave your aura by any means un til the end of your next turn. Additionally, hostile creatures who enter your aura for the first time each turn take radiant damage equal to your Proficiency Bonus.


### Greater Armor of Faith

When you reach 10th level, your faith shields you to an even greater effect than before. You add half your Proficiency Bonus to your Armor Class while you aren't wearing heavy armor or wielding a shield.

### Eyes of the Gods

Starting at 14th level, your connection to providence grants you sight that allows you to hunt the enemies of your deity more effectively. As an action, you can gain truesight for up to 120 feet until the end of your next turn.

### Endless Enmity

At 20th level, your Oath of Enmity no longer expends a use of Channel Divinity. You may only target one creature at a time with Oath of Enmity, and if you target a second creature while the first is still affected, the effect ends for them.

## Avenger Sect

To be an avenger is to act solely on behalf of your deity, working as a divine weapon that is sent out wherever you are needed. Most avengers learn how to best serve their deity through particular sects, which have their own teachings and methods to wield the awesome power granted to them by their deity.

### Dervish of the Dawn

Practicioners of this particular temple sect believe that avengers bring with them the light of dawn, and participate in traditions of dance and performative arts that bring the warmth of the dawn to others who would seek it. In battle, they are holy warriors that bring upon a dance of steel to eviscerate their foes.

#### Sword Dance

At 3rd level, you can enter a special combat stance called a sword dance as a bonus action. While you're in this stance, you have the following benefits:

- You can make a melee weapon attack as a bonus action, which benefits from your ability modifier.
- Each time you hit a creature with a one-handed weapon, and you're able to attack with a second weapon, add the damage dice of both weapons to the damage roll.
- Each time you hit a creature with a weapon, you can move up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks.

Your sword dance ends after 1 minute, or if you end your turn without moving more than 10 feet during the turn.

#### Performance Artist

Also at 3rd level, you have proficiency in Performance (unless you already had it). Your Proficiency Bonus is doubled for any ability check you make using Performance if you're dancing for at least 1 minute before the check.

#### Enchanting Presence

At 7th level, your dance can inspire or enthrall others near you. If you spend at least 1 minute performing a dance, at the end of the performance, choose a number of humanoids within 60 feet of you who participated as your audience, up to a number equal to your Wisdom modifier. Choose one of the following effects to apply to those targets:

- Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you. The DC is equal to your passive Performance score. While charmed this way, the targets are enthralled by you, and will hinder anyone who attempts to oppose you, though they will avoid violent means unless they were already inclined to fight on your behalf. The charm ends on a target after 1 hour, if they take any damage, or if you attack them or any of their allies.
- Each target gains a number of temporary hit points equal to your Charisma (Performance) modifier. While they have these temporary hit points, they cannot be frightened.

#### Dervish Sweep
At 11th level, your weapon attacks become like that of a reaper. When you make a weapon attack and hit, you may choose another creature within 5 ft. of the original target and within your weapon's reach. If your attack roll with that attack would hit this creature, they also take damage from the attack. You can only make one Dervish Sweep per turn.

#### Dawnbringer

When you reach 18th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapons during a sword dance with the light of dawn. As part of starting a sword dance, you can apply the following benefits in addition to the normal effects:

- Your attacks always apply the damage of your holy censure, even if a hit creature didn't trigger the censure, and the damage of your holy censure is doubled.
- Your weapons magically shed bright light for 20 feet, and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light produced by your weapons is sunlight.
- When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you regain 5 hit points.
- You are immune to the grappled and restrained conditions, and difficult terrain doesn't slow you down.

### Oathsworn

Those who are part of the Oathsworn sect fully embody becoming an instrument of their deity, and learn to channel their oath of enmity to greater effect with the vengeful wrath of the heavens.

#### Oathbond

When you choose this sect at 3rd level, you can use your Oath of Enmity channel divinity to mark someone as a pariah of your deity. The following effects apply when such a creature is marked:

- As a bonus action, you can teleport within 30 feet of the marked creature to an empty space you can see.
- You always apply the damage of your holy censure to the marked creature.
- The marked creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against you.

Once you mark someone this way, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

#### Teaching of the Temple

At 7th level, you gain proficiency in Religion and History, your Proficiency Bonus is doubled for these skills, and you gain proficiency in either Intelligence or Wisdom saving throws.
#### Improved Censure

At 11th level, when you would deal damage with your holy censure, you also deal that damage to each creature of your choice within the aura of your Spiritual Temple. The sins commmitted by your foe are shared among the others who would stand in your way.

#### Final Oath

At 18th level, your oathbond feature improves, and now lasts until you or the marked creature die. While oathbond is active, you and the marked creature have vulnerability to the damage of each others' attacks. Additionally, if the marked creature attempts to teleport or enter another plane, they must succeed in a contest between their Charisma and your Wisdom. If they fail the contest, they do not teleport or enter another plane, but still expend resources as usual.

You may pre-emptively end the effects of oathbond as an action. If you do, you cannot use oathbond for seven days.


### Favored Soul

Your sect teaches that avengers, who carry a divine spark of their deity within them, are destined to become angels to serve the deity as part of an ascension rite. As a favored soul, you can eventually manifest the powers of the celestials to further the cause of your deity.

#### Divine Spellcasting

At 3rd level upon picking this sect, you gain the ability to cast spells as a cleric does. 

***Cantrips.*** You learn two cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list, and a third cleric cantrip at 10th level.

***Spell Slots.*** The Favored Soul Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

***Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher.*** You know a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + one-third of your avenger levels (rounded up). Some of these spells must be spells found in the Life Domain Spells table of the cleric, as shown in the Favored Soul Spellcasting table.

Whenever you complete a long rest, you can replace one or more of the cleric spelsl you know with other spells from the cleric spell list. The new spells must be of a level for which you have slots, and if you're replacing a domain spell, the spell you replace it with must also be a domain spell.

***Spellcasting Ability.*** Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. Much like a cleric, the power of your spells comes from the faith and belief in your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability, and your Wisdom modifier to determine the saving throw DC or attack rolls for your cleric spells.

 **Spell Save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
 
 **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier 

##### Favored Soul Spellcasting

| 19th| 3 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 1 |
| 20th| 3 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 1 |

#### Radiant Smite

Also at 3rd level, you can expend spell slots to empower your weapon attacks much like a paladin. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one of the spell slots granted to you by this subclass to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 1d10 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d10 for each spell level higher than first, to a maximum of 4d10.

When you roll this damage, choose a creature within 30 feet of you, including yourself. That creature regains hitpoints equal to half of the radiant damage dealt this way.

#### Heaven's Boon
At 7th level, you sprout a pair of feathery wings from your back. The feathers can be of any pattern and color as you like, and these wings grant you a flight speed equal to your move speed. You can use this flight speed only while you wear no armor or light armor, and aren't holding a shield.

#### Wings of Angels
Starting at 11th level, you can use your flight to assault an entire group of foes. If you are able to use your flight speed, you can use an action to fly through a 10-ft radius circular area originating from you, and make a melee attack against any number of creatures, rolling a separate attack roll for each target.

#### Celestial Spark

When you reach 18th level, your celestial apotheosis is complete. You are now an  angel, and you are both a humanoid and a celestial creature. You also have the following benefits:
- Your flight speed with your wings is doubled.
- You gain darkvision, up to 120 ft. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gold.
- You have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- When you restore hit points to a creature, you can also end a disease, or the blinded, deafened, or poisoned conditions on them.

### Zealous Assassin

The temple sect you are associated with are practioners of secretive assassination arts, allowing these avengers to execute the enemies of their deity. You are a blade guided by providence to destroy your deity's foes, utilizing a combination of divine shadows and deadly, destructive precision with your weapon.


#### Divine Shroud

When you take up this sect at 3rd level, you gain the ability to hide yourself from supernatural sensors. You can always hide from creatures as if they didn't have truesight, and divination or telepathy can't be used to detect your presence.

#### Finishing Technique

Also at 3rd level, your attacks become more vicious when striking at vulnerable foes. Once per turn, you can deal bonus damage to a target that you hit with a weapon attack, if they are at half of their maximum Hit Points or less, or if you have advantage on the attack roll. This bonus damage is equal to a number of 1d6 times your Proficiency Bonus, and is of the same type of damage as your weapon attack.

#### Holy Diver

At 7th level, your faith guides your aerial movements. Add your Wisdom score to the distance you can jump horizontally, and your Wisdom modifier to the distance you can jump vertically.
If you fall from a great height, you can use your reaction to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, negating the damage that results from the fall on a success and preventing yourself from falling prone.

#### Zealot's Veil

Starting at 11th level, you can use a bonus action to become invisible and charge forward in a straight line up to your move speed. If you make an attack while you're invisible and hit, you critically hit instead, provided you moved 10 feet or more this way. This invisibility ends after you make an attack, cast a spell, or your turn ends.

#### Blade of the Zealot

When you reach 18th level, you can channel divine power into your weapon to  combust your foes with holy fire. 

When you make a melee weapon attack and hit a creature, you can make your weapon ignite, causing all damage that the attack would deal to become radiant damage and cause the hit target to catch ablaze with a fire of light. While ignited, the target takes 10 radiant damage at the start of each of its turns, and it can make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turn, quenching the fire on a success. The save DC is equal to 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your Proficiency Bonus. Also, while ignited this way, you have advantage on all attack rolls against the target.

Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you take a long rest.
