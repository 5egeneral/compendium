## The Avenger

A stoic human warrior dressed in nothing but sacred robes darts down an alleyway with his greatsword, muttering an oath to destroy the bugbear that is preparing to strike down an innocent victim. The faith he has in his deity ensures himself that he will not fail to fulfill his duty.

Flapping her wings, an elf with a flowing garb dives into a swathe of goblins, swinging her maul through and through as she darts between enemies who fruitlessly retaliate with their daggers and spears.

The dragonborn prepares his mighty greataxe to strike down an evil necromancer, and with a whisper, seemingly vanishes through the hallway of the mausoleum. The next moment, they reappear, bringing down justice granted to him through their god to the sinister wizard, ending his plot to disturb those who rest in peace.

To be an avenger is to be a holy warrior who fights for their deity before all else. These esoteric warriors train under the rites of religious sects often hidden from public view, learning the secret techniques of their order, and become imbued with the divine might of their deity through sacred rites of initiation. As an avenger, you might work alongside clerics and priests of a particular deity, but you only answer to the deity directly, and the vows of your temple sect.

### Holy Censure
The actions of your foes empower your attacks, punishing them for their defiance in the face of your deity.

Starting at 1st level, choose one of the following censure options. Each one indicates conditions for a hostile creature to be marked by your holy censure. While a creature is marked accordingly, your melee weapon attacks deal bonus radiant damage to them equal to your Proficiency Bonus. You can change your censure option after a short or long rest, spending 10 minutes of that rest praying to your deity. You must be bearing a holy symbol in order to make use of your holy censure.

***Censure of Pursuit.*** When a hostile creature leaves your reach willingly, they are marked by the censure until the end of your next turn.

***Censure of Retribution.*** Whenever a hostile creature deals damage to you, they are marked by the censure until the end of your next turn.

***Censure of Unity.*** When a hostile creature is attacked by an ally, they are marked by the censure until the end of your next turn.

***Censure of Ignorance.*** When a hostile creature makes an attack against an ally you can see, they are marked by the censure until the end of your next turn.

### Armor of Faith

Also at 1st level, you are protected by your unwavering faith you have in your sworn oath to your deity. While you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 13 + your Wisdom modifier.

### Channel Divinity

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.

Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Wisdom modifier.

#### Channel Divinity: Oath of Enmity
As a bonus action, you can swear an oath to your deity to bring down a creature you can see within 60 feet of you, using your Channel Divinity. You gain advantage on melee attack rolls against the creature for 1 minute or until it drops to 0 hit points or falls unconscious. During this time, the target is vulnerable to the damage dealt by your holy censure.

#### Channel Divinity: Divine Guidance
As a reaction while holding or presenting the holy symbol of your deity, you can use your Channel Divinity to give an ally advantage on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw they make during the current turn.

### Temple Sect
When you reach 3rd level, [make a choice of religious sect to be a part of](#avenger-sectss). Many avengers are already part of a sect while training as an agent of their deity, but some avengers have decided to split from their associated temple, working solely on behalf of their deity. Regardless, your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th level, 11th level, and 18th level.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th level, 12th level, 16th level, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. 

### Spiritual Temple

Starting at 6th level, you gain the ability to project a reflection of your soul, a spiritual temple, that provides a number of magical effects. It is represented by an aura emanating from you with a radius equal to to 5 times your Wisdom modifier (minimum 5 ft.), and can be activated or deactivated as a bonus action. The aura, while active, produces an illusionary light or dim shadows within its' radius, which do not affect vision.

If the spiritual temple requires a creature to make a saving throw, the DC is 8 + your Wisdom Modifier + your Proficiency Bonus.

You start out with one effect for your spiritual temple, chosen from the following list. At 9th, 13th, and 17th level, you gain access to an additional effect. You may only have one effect active at a time, and can switch the effect as an action.

***Temple of Shadow.*** While your spiritual temple is active, you and any number of other creatures within the aura are cloaked in shadows, granting advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide, and bright light within the radius is treated as if it is dim light. As a reaction, you can jump through these shadows, teleporting to a location within the radius of your aura.

***Temple of Seclusion.*** When a hostile creature ends their turn within your aura, you can use your reaction to teleport them away to an empty space that is in contact with the outer edge of your aura. Additionally, while you have no more than one hostile creature in your aura, you deal bonus radiant damage equal to your Proficiency Bonus to them whenever you hit them with a melee weapon attack.

***Temple of Respite.*** While your spiritual temple is active, when you or allied creatures regain hit points, the minimum amount of hit points they regain is equal to your Proficiency Bonus. You can use your reaction when a hostile creature attempts to enter your aura to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, their speed is reduced to 0 until the end of their turn.

***Temple of Brilliance.*** As a reaction to a creature making an attack within your aura, you can cause the aura to flare up, blinding the creature until the end of their turn unless they succeed on a Constitution saving throw. Additionally, you glow with a holy light, granting you advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Temple of Light.*** Your spiritual temple imbues radiant energy into your attacks and those of your allies. Whenever a friendly creature in your aura makes a melee attack and hits for the first time each turn, the attack deals bonus radiant damage equal to your Proficiency Bonus. Additionally, the aura radiates bright light up to its' radius, and magical darkness within the radius is treated as if it didn't exist.

***Temple of Resolution.*** Your spiritual temple compels foes to meet their end, and prevents interference from outsiders. When a hostile creature starts their turn in your aura, you can use your reaction to force them to make a Charisma saving throw. If they fail, they cannot willingly leave your aura by any means un til the end of your next turn. Additionally, hostile creatures who enter your aura for the first time each turn take radiant damage equal to your Proficiency Bonus.

### Temple Sect Feature

At 7th level, you gain a feature from your [Temple Sect](#avenger-sects).

### Greater Armor of Faith

When you reach 10th level, your faith shields you to an even greater effect than before. You add half your Proficiency Bonus to your Armor Class while you aren't wearing heavy armor or wielding a shield.

### Temple Sect Feature

At 11th level, you gain a feature from your [Temple Sect](#avenger-sects).

### Eyes of the Gods

Starting at 14th level, your connection to providence grants you sight that allows you to hunt the enemies of your deity more effectively. As an action, you can gain truesight for up to 120 feet until the end of your next turn.

### Temple Sect Feature

At 18th level, you gain a feature from your [Temple Sect](#avenger-sects).

### Endless Enmity

At 20th level, your Oath of Enmity no longer expends a use of Channel Divinity. You may only target one creature at a time with Oath of Enmity, and if you target a second creature while the first is still affected, the effect ends for them.

### Avenger Sects

To be an avenger is to act solely on behalf of your deity, working as a divine weapon that is sent out wherever you are needed. Most avengers learn how to best serve their deity through particular sects, which have their own teachings and methods to wield the awesome power granted to them by their deity.

#### Dervish of the Dawn

Practicioners of [[Avenger Sects#Dervish of the Dawn\|this particular temple sect]] believe that avengers bring with them the light of dawn, and participate in traditions of dance and performative arts that bring the warmth of the dawn to others who would seek it. In battle, they are holy warriors that bring upon a dance of steel to eviscerate their foes.

#### Oathsworn

Those who are part of the [[Avenger Sects#Oathsworn\|Oathsworn sect]] fully embody becoming an instrument of their deity, and learn to channel their oath of enmity to greater effect with the vengeful wrath of the heavens.

#### Favored Soul

This sect teaches that avengers, who carry a divine spark of their deity within them, are destined to become angels to serve the deity as part of an ascension rite. As a [[Avenger Sects#Favored Soul\|Favored Soul]], you can eventually manifest the powers of the celestials to further the cause of your deity.

#### Zealous Assassin

The adherents of this temple sect are [[Avenger Sects#Zealous Assassin\|practioners of secretive assassination arts]], allowing these avengers to execute the enemies of their deity. You are a blade guided by providence to destroy your deity's foes, utilizing a combination of divine shadows and deadly, destructive precision with your weapon.
