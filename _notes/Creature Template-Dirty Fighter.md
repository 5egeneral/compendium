Whether out of malice, fear, or a strong desire to succeed, a dirty fighter doesn't play by the rules. They will do whatever it takes to win, including taking the cheapest shots possible and ambushing foes in order to ensure the greatest chance of success.

The monster gains one of the following utility-based traits.

***Battle Adept.*** Opportunity attacks against the monster have disadvantage, and the monster's opportunity attacks against other creatures have advantage.

***Brawler (Bonus Action).*** The monster attempts to grapple or shove a creature within its reach.

***Cheap Shot (1/Turn).*** If the monster makes a weapon attack with advantage on the attack roll and hits, the target can't take reactions and has its speed halved until the end of the monster's next turn.

***Evade Foes (Bonus Action).*** The monster takes the Disengage or Dodge action.

***Limited Reactiveness.*** The monster can take two reactions per round in combat.

The monster also gains one of the following offense-based traits.

***Cut Down.*** The monster has advantage on weapon attack rolls against any creature that has half of its hit points or fewer.

***Deadly Critical.*** The monster scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 and rolls the damage dice three times, instead of twice.

***Surprise Attack.*** If the monster surprises a creature and hits it with an attack during the first round of combat, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) damage from the attack.

***Vicious Retaliation.*** In response to being hit by a melee attack, the monster can make one melee attack against the attacker.

***Wounded Fury.*** While it has half of its hit points or fewer, the monster has advantage on attack rolls. In addition, it deals an extra 7 (2d6) damage to any target it hits with a melee attack.
