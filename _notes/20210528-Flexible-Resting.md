Completing a long rest in the wilderness is a daunting task in and of itself. A long rest is a 24‑hour period of light activity and high‑quality sleep. Combat and travel both interrupt a long rest. A short rest takes at least half an hour.

A character who benefits from a long rest must wait 48 hours before starting a long rest again.

A long rest restores half a character’s remaining hit dice, and all hit points. 

Finishing an 8‑hour rest \[overnight rest\] lets a creature lower her exhaustion level by 1, as well as roll one hit die without expending any resources.

A character cannot benefit from a long rest or an 8-hour rest if he is not sufficiently protected from exposure in windy weather, dry in wet weather, or warm in cold weather.
