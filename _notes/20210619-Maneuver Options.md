If you have access to maneuvers, the following maneuvers can be added to the list of options available to you. Maneuvers are made available by features like the Combat Superiority class feature, the Superior Technique fighting style, and the Martial Adept feat.

#### Break Free
When you start your turn while grappled or restrained, you can expend one superiority die and use a bonus action to immediately attempt to break free from each effect causing those conditions. Roll the superiority die and add the number rolled to the check or saving throw for each effect.

#### Crippling Attack
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to temporarily cripple the target. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and until the end of your next turn, the target can't take reactions and has its speed halved.

#### Defensive Roll
When you make a Dexterity saving throw, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to add it to the save. You can use this maneuver before or after making the save, but before any consequences of the roll take effect. After the effect occurs, you can then move up to half your speed as part of the same reaction.

#### Fast Footwork
*Replaces Evasive Footwork*

When you move, you can expend one superiority die, rolling the die and adding the number rolled to your AC until the start of your next turn or until you become unable to move.

#### Glancing Blow
When you miss a target with a weapon attack that isn't a critical miss, you can expend one superiority die to deal a glancing blow to the target. The target takes damage equal to the number you roll on your superiority die, and the damage type is chosen from among those that can be dealt by your weapon.

#### Great Fortitude
When you make a saving throw against disease, exhaustion, poison, or being paralyzed or stunned, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the roll. You can use this maneuver before or after making the save, but before any consequences of the roll take effect.

#### Iron Will
When you make a saving throw against being charmed or frightened, or against taking psychic damage, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the roll. You can use this maneuver before or after making the save, but before any consequences of the roll take effect.

#### Knock Away
When you attempt to shove a creature, you can expend one superiority die and add it to your Strength (Athletics) check. You can then attempt to push another creature within 5 feet of the original target with the same motion. If your original check beats the creature's contested check, it also gets shoved in the same way as the original creature (knocked prone or pushed 5 feet away).

#### Monster Expert
When you make an ability check to gain information about one or more hostile creatures you can see, you can expend one superiority die and add the superiority die to the ability check.

#### Spring Attack
When you take the Disengage or Dodge action on your turn, you can use your bonus action to expend one superiority die and make a single weapon attack. If you hit, add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.

#### Survivalist
When you make an Intelligence (Nature), a Wisdom (Animal Handling), or a Wisdom (Survival) check, you can expend one superiority die and add the superiority die to the ability check.

#### Vault
When you make a high or long jump, you can expend one superiority die, rolling the die and adding the number rolled plus your proficiency bonus to the distance you cover. This extra distance costs you no movement and does not provoke opportunity attacks.
