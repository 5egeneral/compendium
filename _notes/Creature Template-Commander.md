A commander is a monster that is slightly smarter, wiser, or more charismatic compared to its kin or peers, granting it natural leadership skills that it can use in combat. For more guidelines for creating leader monsters, see my [Warlord Collection](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LtrZrYqZl6TBt8gu9lt) homebrew. 

***Ability Score Adjustment.*** The monster's Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score increases by 2.

***Hit Dice.*** The monster gains two hit dice.

***Command Ally (Bonus Action).*** The monster targets one ally it can see within 30 feet of it. If the ally can see and hear the monster, it can make one weapon attack as a reaction and gains advantage on the attack roll.

***Leadership (Action; Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** For 1 minute, the monster can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a d4 to its roll provided it can hear and understand the monster. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the monster is incapacitated.
