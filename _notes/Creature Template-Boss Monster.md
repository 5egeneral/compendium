The best way to turn a normal creature into a boss monster is to give it mythic traits and actions. You can use this template if you want an abbreviated process that you can elaborate on later. If you wish to make this monster a solo boss, choose a base creature with a CR that is equal to or slightly less than the average party level.

First, give the monster some legendary resistances and a mythic trait. If you'd like, you can replace Legendary Resistance with one of the alternative traits presented earlier in this document, and you can add extra effects that trigger alongside the mythic trait.

***Last Stand (Mythic Trait; Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** If the monster is reduced to 0 hit points, it doesn't die or fall unconscious. Instead, it regains all of its hit points.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the monster fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

Next, give the monster three legendary actions; you can adjust this number up or down if you have more or less than four characters in the party. Then, give the monster three of the legendary action options below.

- **Move.** The monster moves up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
- **Detect.** The monster makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.
- **At-Will Spell.** The monster casts one of its at-will spells.
- **Weak Attack.** The monster uses one of its weaker attacks.
- **Recharge (Costs 2 Actions).** The monster recharges one of its actions and uses it.

Finally, give the monster three of the mythic actions below.

- **Rush.** The monster moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
- **Strong Attack.** The monster uses one of its strong attacks, or it uses one of its weaker attacks twice.
- **Assault (Costs 2 Actions).** The monster gains advantage on all attack rolls until the end of its next turn.
- **Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions).** The monster casts a spell.
- **Defend (Costs 2 Actions).** The monster gains advantage on all saving throws until the end of its next turn.
