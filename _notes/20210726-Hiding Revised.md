Both in and out of combat, hiding is an activity where you attempt to remain undetected by one or more creatures. If successful, it can be used to sneak through hostile areas or get the drop on unsuspecting foes in combat.

While the sections below provide guidance for general cases, remember that the DM ultimately decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding.

### Requirements
While in combat, you can take the Hide action. While traveling, you can attempt to hide while moving at a slow pace. Otherwise, you can simply attempt to hide during the time you have available to you.

In order to avoid detection, you need some way to hide. You can't simply stand in the middle of an empty, lit room and hope to avoid notice. Something must conceal you, perhaps a large object, a piece of terrain, or an immobile creature of an appropriate size, such as a slumbering dragon. Regardless of what obscures you, the thing must cover at least half your body for you to hide.

***Obscured Areas.*** An environmental phenomenon that heavily obscures you can also provide a means to hide. A heavily obscured area typically contains darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage that entirely blocks vision of you. Some creatures, such as those with the Skulker feat, have special abilities that allow them to try to hide in areas that are lightly obscured. A lightly obscured area typically contains dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage that partially obstructs your body. See Chapter 8 of the *Player's Handbook* (page 183) for more information on vision and being obscured.

An invisible creature can't be seen, so it can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, however, and it still has to stay quiet, as detailed below.

***Staying Quiet.*** It's assumed that you try to avoid making noise while hiding. If you make a noise, such as yelling a warning to an ally or knocking over a vase, you give away your position to any creature that hears you and thus are no longer hidden from them.

### Success
You normally have to make a check using the Stealth skill to avoid being detected, but the type of check will vary depending on the situation. An Intelligence (Stealth) or Wisdom (Stealth) check might be used to find the best hiding spot possible before a bandit patrol arrives, while a Charisma (Stealth) check could be used to blend into a crowd, causing the guards chasing you to lose track of your whereabouts. In most other cases, and especially in combat, the default is a Dexterity (Stealth) check.

Normally, this check is made when you first attempt to hide; you then use this total until you are discovered or stop hiding, or until the DM asks you to reroll due to changing circumstances. However, to avoid metagaming, and to add tension to a high stakes situation, the DM may instead have you (re)roll the check only at the moment of possible detection.

Whether or not this check succeeds can be determined in one of three ways, as detailed below.

***Ability Contest.*** A creature that is actively looking for hidden creatures typically contests your check with their own Intelligence or Wisdom check. The default skill for this check is Perception, but the Investigation or Survival skills can be used instead depending on the circumstances.

***Passive Perception.*** When you hide, there's a chance someone will notice you even if they aren't searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the DM compares your check with that creature's passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature's Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5.

For example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and a proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 14.

***Set DC.*** Instead of passive Perception, the DM may decide to simply set a DC according to how difficult they think hiding should be in a particular scenario. This approach works well when there is a group of creatures with different passive Perception scores that can be hard to keep track of, and it can also be used to account for niche cases where a creature might be abnormally inattentive or alert.

### Benefits
The most obvious benefit of being hidden is preventing other creatures from knowing your whereabouts. However, being hidden also grants you a few special benefits.

***Advantage on Attacks.*** In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the DM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack before you are seen (see “Being Detected” below).

***Attack Protection.*** A creature from which you are hidden has disadvantage on attack rolls against you, whether it can hear but not see you or is merely guessing your location. If you aren't in the location the creature targets, it automatically misses, but it usually only knows that the attack missed, not that it guessed incorrectly.

***Surprise.*** If you and your companions are hidden, you can gain surprise over unsuspecting foes that you initiate combat with. See Chapter 9 of the *Player's Handbook* (page 189) for the rules on being surprised.

### Being Detected
If you lose the conditions needed to remain hidden, you are automatically spotted, as long as a creature is looking in your direction. You might hide around a corner, and then creep past a guard who is looking the other way.

When in doubt, the DM might allow you to avoid detection during these brief moments if your check succeeds in a contest or against the DC by 5 or more.
