A berserk monster is some sort of beast or other creature that has gone on an unstoppable rampage. Such creatures are often described to be feral or to have gone mad, and present a threat to anyone unfortunate enough to cross paths with them.

***Saving Throws.*** The monster gains proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. If it already has this proficiency, it instead gains advantage on all Wisdom saving throws.

***Aggressive (Bonus Action).*** The monster moves up to its speed toward a hostile creature that it can see.

***Reckless.*** At the start of its turn, the monster can gain advantage on all melee weapon attack rolls during that turn, but attack rolls against it have advantage until the start of its next turn.

***Unbreakable (3/Day).*** If the monster is incapacitated at the start of its turn, the effect causing this condition immediately ends on the monster.
