Bards of the college of iconoclasm are revolutionaries who fight against tyrants and corrupt regimes. They exist to speak truth to power, incite resistance, and even lead insurgencies themselves. To better accomplish their goals, they supplement their bardic magic with combat training and destructive spells.

#### Bonus Proficiencies
When you join the College of Iconoclasm, you gain proficiency with medium armour, shields, and martial weapons.

#### Vermilion Spellcraft
At 3rd level, you learn two cantrips from the wizard spell list that require you to make an attack roll. Additionally, whenever you learn new bard spells, you can instead choose spells of the evocation school from the wizard spell list. These are considered bard spells for you.

#### Dualcast
Also at 3rd level, when you cast a bard spell, you can spend one use of bardic inspiration to cast a cantrip you know as a bonus action.

#### Extra Attack
At 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

#### Improved Spell Critical
Also at 6th level, your spell attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

#### Embolden
At 14th level, you can spend an action to grant one bardic inspiration die to all allies within 60 feet who can hear you. You can use this feature once, and cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.

#### Superior Spell Critical
Also at 14th level, your spell attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 18-20.
