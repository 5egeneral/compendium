Creature templates are preset modifications and additions you can apply to existing monsters. You can use a creature template to represent the conversion of a specific monster into something new (e.g. a zombie), or you can use one to add variety to an otherwise homogenous group of monsters.

## Official Templates
The dracolich template and other templates included in the *Monster Manual* are examples of templates that transform a given monster into something new. However, the *Dungeon Master's Guide* also includes a table for NPC Features (DMG 282), which it states can be applied to existing monsters to cause them to be members of specific races.

## Usage
The creature templates in this chapter are designed to modify how a given monster behaves in combat. For example, the Berserk Monster template can be used to turn a normally docile beast into a feral horror, while the Lurk template can be used to turn a simple warrior into a stealthy assassin.

### Typical Changes
A creature template can change any of a monster's statistics, but there are certain statistics that are more likely to be changed than others.

***Ability Score Adjustments.*** Some templates will increase or decrease a monster's ability scores. For example, the zombie template in the DMG decreases a monster's Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores (to represent the loss of brain function) while also increasing its Strength and Constitution scores (to represent the increase in physical might).

***Hit Dice.*** Some templates will increase the number of hit dice possessed by a monster. This can represent a notable increase in physical fortitude, but it may also serve to balance out a significant increase in offensive power granted by other parts of the template.

***New Proficiencies.*** A template might grant a monster extra skill or saving throw proficiencies. The former represents the monster being adept at a specific skillset (e.g. being stealthy), while the latter represents the monster having greater physical or mental defenses than others of its kind. If a monster is already proficient in a specific skill, it might gain expertise in that skill, meaning that it can double its proficiency bonus when making a check with that skill. Meanwhile, a monster that is already proficient in a specific saving throw might gain advantage on all saving throws of that type.

***New Resistances and Immunities.*** A template might also grant a monster additional damage resistances, damage immunities, or condition immunities (or even damage vulnerabilities). For example, the zombie template in the DMG grants a creature immunity to poison damage, exhaustion, and the poisoned condition, which represents the advantages of its undead physiology compared to the base creature.

***New Features.*** Finally, a template is likely to grant a monster access to new traits and abilities as appropriate. For example, the gnoll template in the DMG gives a monster the Rampage trait, while the kuo-toa template grants a monster the Amphibious, Otherworldly Perception, Slippery, and Sunlight Sensitivity traits.

### Challenge Rating
Because a template can be applied to so many different monsters, there is no listed value for how it will affect a monster's Challenge Rating; once you apply one of these templates, recalculate the monster's Challenge Rating. For guidance on this matter, see the "Monster Features Revisited" section earlier in this document.

> ### Modifying Templates
> These templates are just a starting point for your monsters. Don't feel the need to constrain yourself to their limitations, or to avoiding using abilities that aren't mentioned in their descriptions.
> 
> It's also worth noting that many of these templates simply piece together some of the monster features discussed earlier in this document. For example, the Bodyguard template simply combines my monster version of the Alert feat with pieces of the Polearm Master and Sentinel feats. Thus, you can view these as example applications of the other content in this document, whereas you are free to ignore or deviate from them as you see fit.
