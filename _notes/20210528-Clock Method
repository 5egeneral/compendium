Roll 3d6 and sum the numbers. Repeat this process until you have a sequence of thirteen numbers.  
Arrange these thirteen numbers in a circle, or imagine them as so.

- You may remove any one number from the sequence, reducing the count to twelve. Do not change the order of the numbers.
- At any point you may select a sequence of numbers from your arrangment. They must be in order, clockwise or counterclockwise.
- This sequence will be, in order from the first number chosen, your ability scores, in the order: Str, Dex, Con, Int, Wis, Cha.
- In the event that half or more of your values are 9 or lower, or with DM's permission, you may reroll your entire sequence.


This system adds some randomness and variability, which I think adds some emergent properties to the game, but also allows for control over character specific attributes. This is not the style for people who dislike needlessly complicated systems or had a very particular character in mind. Then again, what are you doing here?
