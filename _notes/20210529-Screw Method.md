Construct three pairs from each of your attribute scores. For example, Strength – Dex, Int – Wis, Cha – Con.

Roll a d11. Add 7 to the result. Assign this to one of the attribute scores within a pair of your choice. The other attribute score within the pair is [25 minus the first result]. For example, if a player rolled 3, one attribute score will be 10 [3+7], the other will be 15 [25-10]. 

Repeat this process 3 times, once for each pair. You can assign pairs of attributes within any pair as you prefer.

> **In practice.**  
> John decides to pair Str and Wis, Con and Dex, and Cha and Int.  
> John rolls a d11 three times, rolling a **7**, **4**, and **8**.  
> This results in the pairs [**14-11**], [**11-14**], and [**15-10**]  
> He assigns the first pair to Con and Dex, the second pair to Str and Wis, and the third pair to Cha and Int.  
> This results in the following pairs: [**14 Dex 11 con**], [**11 Str 14 Wis**], and [**15 Int 10 Cha**].  
> He then applies racial ASIs as normal.
