# Contributing directly to the Compendium

You can contribute directly to the Compendium by adding a markdown file in the [notes folder.](https://github.com/5egeneral/compendium/tree/main/_notes)

Each file begins with the date it is added, in YYYYMMDD format, followed by a dash, and is closed by the file extension, `.md `. (On the 28th of May 2021 this would result in a file called **20210528-Document Name.md**)

Make sure to paste the [metadata template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5egeneral/compendium/main/metadatatemplate.md) at the top. If you are unsure how to tag a submission, have a look at [the tags page](https://5eg-compendium.netlify.app/tags/) to see which tags already exist. Tags are separated with commas and are placed between brackets.

If you prefer learning visually, you can have a look at the demonstration in the link below. (Click the image!)

If that seems too daunting, you can instead open an issue and link to a pastebin with your document in markdown formatting.
